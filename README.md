# Chrysalis-Gatsby
I'm building out my portfolio website with GatsbyJS.

The original WordPress site is here: https://www.chrysaliswebdevelopment.com

The new Gatsby site is in progress here: https://chrysalis-gatsby.netlify.app/

In this project, I'm also using TailWindCSS to explore its capabilities.
